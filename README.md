# makhomai-starter-pack

## Getting started

You can write your bot in the `starter_bots` folder. When submitting make a zip file of the folder your bot is in. Make sure your bot is called `MyBot`, (e.g. `MyBot.py`). Additionally, make sure your files are in the root of the zip file.

### Testing locally

Each starter bot contains a `./play_one_game.sh` that runs your bot against a couple of others from the `sample_bots` folder. Feel free to pick a different map or bot (perhaps even your old bots) by changing the script.

Use `./play_one_game.sh "python starter_bots/python/MyBot.py"` to run a game.

## Submitting your bot

Upload the created zip file onto the website to start competing.

## Requirements

Currently only MacOS is supported.

For a Python bot you must have Python 3 installed.
